	Activity 1: Seeing if we can link to goddamn JQuery<br/>
	Open the goddamn console to see if we can<br/>
	P.S. Sorry for all the goddamns, just the sort of mood I'm in...<br/>
	P.P.S. OK, this is version 2.0, trying to do it with jQuery shorthand:<br/>
	Although, gotta level with you, it doesn't seem very short to me<br/>

	$(window).on ("load" , function()
		{if (window.jQuery) 
			{console.log("Yes, we have jQuery..."); }
		 else
			{console.log("Something went not right, the Error it Occurred");
			 console.log("Ummm or to put it another way, jQuery has KNOT loaded");
			 console.log("Actually after writing all of this, part of me is hoping it doesn't load");}
