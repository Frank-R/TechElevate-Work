Version 2.0 15th April 2015 (Happy Birthday Mom!!!)

So far:

"Give Feedback" takes comments and displays them on the "Comments" page.
Updated "Give Feedback" so it form is generated dynamically

Persistent: saves entries

Fixed problem(previously not noticed) whereby every time you left the comments page and went back to it, it would reload the last comment

Still just prints values out, doesn't even have as label e.g. for name, phone number
Also: Thinking in terms of having a comment counter, and saving each comment to its own(numbered) paragraph

Also, not very pretty(CSS needs some work)
